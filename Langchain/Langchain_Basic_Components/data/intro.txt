First of all, Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
I'm Rishikesh Krishna Patil, from New Mumbai.
I recently completed my Post Graduation Diploma in Artificial Intelligence from CDAC pune. and I have completed my graduation from Dy Patil RAIT, Navi Mumbai in year 2023.
Through out this CDAC course, I learned new technologies such as Machine Learning, Deep Neural Network, and Natural Language Processing.
Also I have good understanding of software development, with expertise in programming languages such as Python, SQL and Java. Also I have build knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms and have solved DSA problems on websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks and AlgoExpert.
Based on all this knowledge, I recently created a project named code mixed text translation using python and NLP libraries like PyTorch, NumPy and regular expression.
Also I have published a paper for one of my projects, which involved creating an application using Java and SQL. This project was accepted for presentation at a national conference.
Additionally, I have gained knowledge in UI design and have hands-on practice in designing interfaces using software like Figma and Photoshop.
I have also build my own portfolio, and have deployed it using GitHub pages.
So that's a brief about me.
Thank you.
